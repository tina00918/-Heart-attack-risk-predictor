# Heart-attack-risk-predictor
Problem Statement: Heart attacks are a leading cause of death worldwide. Early prediction of heart attack risk can help doctors take necessary preventive measures and save lives. Machine learning can be used to build predictive models to identify individuals who are at high risk of having a heart attack.

Solution: The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a heart attack for a given individual based on their clinical data. The model should take into account various risk factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes status,Maximum heart rate and Chest Pain level. After the model is developed, the streamlit module of python is used to create a user-interactive web page which takes the input values of the various risk factors and uses the ML Model to predict the possibility of the person being prone to heart attack and displays it.
